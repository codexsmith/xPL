Installing xPL4Linux

Untar the xPL4Linux.tar file into an empty directory.  Go into the xPL4Linux
directory and type make.  This will compile the components of xPL4Linux
library (xPLLib).

If there are no errors (*), you can install it into your systems by becoming
root and typing "make install".  The shared and static libraries are installed
into /usr/local/lib and the xPL.h header file is installed in
/usr/local/include.  You can changed the destinations in the Makefile if you'd
like.

If you do not want a 3rd part programming running as root, here are the steps
to manually install xP4Linux's xPLLib:

1) Make sure you typed "make" and had no errors (a few warnings are OK)

2) As root, copy libxPL.so into your library directory (often
   /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib)

3) Copy the static link library xPL.a into the same place you installed the
   share libxPL.so

4) Install the xPL.h into the system include directory (often
   /usr/local/include or /usr/include)

5) If this is a brand new install of xPLLib, type "ldconfig" to have the
   system library cache updated and made aware of xPLLib

You really only need steps 3 & 4 for machines you will develop and compile
xPLLib based applications on.  If you are deploying a previously compiled
application, you need only do steps #2 and 5

* You'll get a warning about a date formats (2 digit years).  They are harmless.
