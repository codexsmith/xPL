xPL4Linux -- Change History

xPL4Linux V1.3a -- released October 18, 2006

* If you create an xPL message that is too large (larger than a UDP packet is
  allowed to be and if you have debugging enabled, a message indicating the
  message was too large and was discarded is issued and the message is not
  sent.  The logic for not sending message that are too large has been then
  since V1.0, but the addition of printing a debug message is what was added.

* Altered the addServiceListener so an empty schema class or type is the same
  as a null schema class or type (made Kylix interfacing a bit easier)

* Have added a kylix "wrapper" that allows kylix developers to use the same
  API as the C developers.

* Updated xPL_createService so that if the instance ID to use is null, we
  create a unique one for use (like we do with unconfigured services).

* xPLLib will now, by default, scan all network interfaces in order (the order
  listed by ifconfig, usually) until it find a valid, running (i.e. UP),
  non-loopback interface and use that.  Of course, it the xPLLib base app uses
  the xPL_parseCommonArgs call (and it should), you can still manually specify
  which interface to use.

* Fixed a problem whereby the xPL receive code would treat any message from
  the "xpl" vendor as a group message.  This affects the xPLLib and xPL_Hub.

* Fixed a nasty bug in the xPL Hub code that would close connections/ports for
  xPL devices prematurely when more than one device was sharing the same
  port/connection.

xPL4Linux V1.3 - release December 6, 2005

* Implemented full device configuration support (check the
  include CONFIG.txt for notes about it).

* Finished implementation of filters and groups (associated 
  with configuration subsystem).

* Added a new xPL_ServiceSendMessage(theMessage) which should
  be used by any xPL Service (in order to properly take advantage
  of changes in the device instance name/configuration changes)

* Copied the xPL_Clock.c demo program to xPL_ConfigClock.c that
  is very similar, but implements a configurable interface (user
  can configure the instance name heartbeat interval and how
  often the clock sends the time out to the network).

* The xPL_Logger.c demo program has been upgraded to be configurable
  wit hthe ability to both configure if data should append too a log
  file or not and what the log file name is.

* Added a new xPLSend.c program in examples that allows sending xPL
  messages from the command line

* Various small bug fixes.

xPL4Linux V1.2 - released Sept 26, 2005
 * Added support for setting and sending a services version
 * Added support for responding to device discovery request
 * Fixed a bug in xPL Hub logic that would only recognize local
   traffic from a single address on the system vs. from any
   address on the system.

xPL4Linux V1.1 - released 9/16/2005
 * Support for new hub-detection protocol

xPL4Linux V1.0a - released 4/15/2005
 * Minor bug fixes
 * More work on configuration subsystem

xPL4Linux V1.0 - initial release 12/30/2004
