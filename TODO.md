For Determinators:
------------------
Make sure we use the value parser from the RulesManager in all places (like xplconditions...)
Handle groups
Make determinator execution happen in order, and in a separate thread
Implement stop/suspend/delay actions

For more XHCP:
--------------
Group support
RELOAD / occasional save of determinators/globals
Figure out what 'settings' are
runrule may be wrong - ignores conditions


For Configuration Manager:
--------------------------
